## 🎮 What is GameBattles?

**GameBattles** is a fully decentralized wager platform for competitive video games. Using blockchain smart contracts, players can bet on the outcome of matches, pool crypto, and let the chain handle payouts — no referees, no disputes, no centralized control.

> Your skill, your terms, your rewards.

<br />

## 🕹️ Why It Matters

Esports isn’t just entertainment. It’s a proving ground.
A place to compete, connect, and profit — not just for the elite, but for everyone.

We grew up dreaming of winning on skill alone. Of making our names without needing a corporate sponsor or a viral moment.
**GameBattles is how we reclaim that dream.**

<br />

## 🔁 How It Works

**Wager. Win. Withdraw.**
All on-chain. No trust required.

1. **Create or Join a Match**
   Define game, rules, wager amount, and participants

2. **Pool Crypto via Smart Contract**
   Automatically locked into an escrow-like state

3. **Play and Report the Outcome**
   Verified through oracles, gameplay APIs, or player consensus

4. **Auto-Disbursement**
   Smart contract pays out winner(s) instantly and transparently

<br />
